# FFXIV-Fish-Simulator
A Barebones Final Fantasy XIV Fishing Simulator

NOW WITH 4 TIMES THE BUTTONS AND 4 TIMES THE FUN!!

Oh. More fish have been added too. So that's pretty neat.

-----------------------------------------------
Buttons are as follows:

- Cast: Casts out your fishing rod

- Hook: Hooks a fish once you get a bite

- Chum: Reduces wait time for your next fish

- Quit: Cancel everything and put away your rod
